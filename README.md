## Project Description: Python Pong Classic üïπÔ∏è

This project is a complete and polished implementation of the classic arcade game **Pong**, built entirely in Python using the `turtle` graphics library.

It's a two-player game where each player controls a paddle using the keyboard (**W/S keys** for the left player, **Up/Down arrow keys** for the right) with the goal of hitting the ball past their opponent. The first player to reach **10 points** wins.

Key features include:
* A **dynamic ball** that speeds up with each successful paddle hit, increasing the challenge.
* A live, real-time **scoreboard**.
* A **pause/resume** feature, activated by the spacebar.
* **Refined collision physics** that prevent common glitches, ensuring smooth and reliable gameplay.
